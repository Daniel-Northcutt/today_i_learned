* 9/28: Further expansion of temporary tables and intro into case statements

* 9/27: I learned about subquerys in SQL, spent most of the day on exercises.  I understand the importance of subquerys but 
I found that I was able to get through the problems running Joins and often could get to the answer with less code.  Regardless it was an 
important lesson to learn.  We also learned about temporary tables which Ryan showed us can be extremely useful in the workplace if you find yourself 
continually writing the same code.  

* 9/23: Further development of join statements in SQL, spent the day on challenging exercises that were rewarding to complete.  Shout out to Ryan, for helping me grasp a greater understanding.
