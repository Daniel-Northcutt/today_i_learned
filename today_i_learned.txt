*10/11: Worked thru exercises via Matplotlib and strengthened my knowledge through the given material.  Ended the day learning about Numpy, which is a super powerful tool for python.

*10/08: Today I learned about Matplotlib.  It was a dense lecture that I plan on working on through the weekend.

* 10/04: Refresher on python functions primarily focused on control structures.  The lecture was straightforward but the exercises proved to be extremely challenging for me. Working through them with my breakout room and help from the TAs was able to strengthen my code.  Need to just work on it everyday to become a stronger programer.

* 10/01: Refreshed python base level skills going over mainly tuples, strings, dictionary, integer, float, etc.  Few exercises to review the basics of python.
(also my son is one month old today! I really enjoy being a father)

* 9/30: Mainly a quiz on SQL and intro to python

* 9/29: Exercises on case statements and spent the evening refreshing myself on SQL in preparing for our quiz

* 9/28: Further expansion of temporary tables and intro into case statements

* 9/27: I learned about subquerys in SQL, spent most of the day on exercises.  I understand the importance of subquerys but 
I found that I was able to get through the problems running Joins and often could get to the answer with less code.  Regardless it was an 
important lesson to learn.  We also learned about temporary tables which Ryan showed us can be extremely useful in the workplace if you find yourself 
continually writing the same code.  

* 9/23: Further development of join statements in SQL, spent the day on challenging exercises that were rewarding to complete.  Shout out to Ryan, for helping me grasp a greater understanding.

* 9/22: Composite Keys, Join Statements, Learned a great deal more on grouping statements
* 9/21: Grouping statements in SQL
* 9/20: Today I learned about SQL Causes and Limit.  I gained a stronger understanding of using querys.
