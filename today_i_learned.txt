11/02: Statistics through pandas.  Lots learned today and lots to still learn.  Review of these
Lessons will be critical.  Followed by a strong lesson on probability distributions.  Followed along
Well but as always I assume that the exercises ahead will require a personal deep dive beyond the
 material to grasp the concepts.

11/01: Great conversation regarding stress and support with our bootcamp.  Appreciate the open communication and strong feedback from Ryan.  Great feedback from our presentations and can only improve with each assignment.  Ended the day with a great stats lesson, excited to practice with the code from our lesson.

10/26: Further discussion into storytelling focused on the "create" stage (yesterday was "understand").  Learned of some new great tools like Trello 
and ways to build the foundation for a project which is new to me without already having my target goal in mind with data.  
Most of the day was exploring data and slogging through spreadsheets, not going to lie that after SQL and pandas, spreadsheets is a chore.


10/25: Focus today was on storytelling.  Great lecture that I took heaps of notes on understanding the importance of narrative to display and project our data.  
Great deal of references and supplemental material through the canva presentation.  Followed with a self-exploration of graph exercise.  Found some amazing resources through the dive.

10/24: Few hours to work on pandas during the weekend.  Even though we have finished the lesson I need to keep these skills sharp.  The more exercises the better I will get.

*10/22: Pandas quiz and review followed by introduction to spreadsheets.  Learned a few new functions 
But most of the lesson I have previously touched at during my employment history.

*10/21: Exercises and review of seaborn. Useful tool that can make some fantastic plots very quickly.
With experience I can see myself capable of making some powerful representation of data using this tool.  Ended the day with a review of pandas.  
This week has been tiring for me so looking forward to getting some rest following tomorrow.

*10/20: Today we reviewed advanced data frames with pandas followed by an introduction to seaborn. 
Overall good day that I followed with more supplemental information.  Appreciate the half day, feel like
I have made good progress the past week but that there is just so much information to maintain.  We will see how the quiz goes tomorrow 

*10/19: Advanced data frames for pandas. Lessons and challenging exercises which took most of the day.  
Was able to finish at the last minute and will clean up my code with the review.  Ryan provided great supplemental material for pandas which I also started working through.  Pandas is dense but essential, 
more problems I work through the better I will get.


*10/18: Python Databases! Review of the exercises finished on Friday/Weekend.  Onto more advanced 
databases which I consider the big accomplishment of the day was learning how to link my SQL 
database onto my Jupyter and thus using pythonic code to query search through the database.  
Also a refresher on .gitignore and the importance of which.  Good lesson to start Monday off

*10/15: Worked through a great deal of pandas exercises, learned some interesting techniques through classmates explaining their code.  Following learned about data frames within pandas.  
The lesson felt dense but clicked very well with me.

*10/14: Started on Pandas primarily through series, vectorized operations,  and plotting.  Power of str. - methods vs attributes

*10/13: Continued numpy and got to improve my skills on list comprehension
Which is always ideal for python.

*10/12: The power of Numpy

*10/11: Worked thru exercises via Matplotlib and strengthened my knowledge through the given material.  Ended the day learning about Numpy, which is a super powerful tool for python.

*10/08: Today I learned about Matplotlib.  It was a dense lecture that I plan on working on through the weekend.

* 10/04: Refresher on python functions primarily focused on control structures.  The lecture was straightforward but the exercises proved to be extremely challenging for me. 
Working through them with my breakout room and help from the TAs was able to strengthen my code.  Need to just work on it everyday to become a stronger programer.

* 10/01: Refreshed python base level skills going over mainly tuples, strings, dictionary, integer, float, etc.  Few exercises to review the basics of python.
(also my son is one month old today! I really enjoy being a father)

* 9/30: Mainly a quiz on SQL and intro to python

* 9/29: Exercises on case statements and spent the evening refreshing myself on SQL in preparing for our quiz

* 9/28: Further expansion of temporary tables and intro into case statements

* 9/27: I learned about subquerys in SQL, spent most of the day on exercises.  I understand the importance of subquerys but 
I found that I was able to get through the problems running Joins and often could get to the answer with less code.  Regardless it was an 
important lesson to learn.  We also learned about temporary tables which Ryan showed us can be extremely useful in the workplace if you find yourself 
continually writing the same code.  

* 9/23: Further development of join statements in SQL, spent the day on challenging exercises that were rewarding to complete.  Shout out to Ryan, for helping me grasp a greater understanding.

* 9/22: Composite Keys, Join Statements, Learned a great deal more on grouping statements
* 9/21: Grouping statements in SQL
* 9/20: Today I learned about SQL Causes and Limit.  I gained a stronger understanding of using querys.
